## Hi there 👋

I'm Josch Bockler, a passionate Ruby on Rails developer who loves crafting scalable and maintainable web applications. My focus is on clean code, performance-driven solutions, and continuous learning.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:
- 🚴‍♂️ Gravel biking on scenic trails or exploring new routes.
- 🧗 Taking on new challenges, whether outdoors or in personal projects.
